The project is a social network site that allows people from the United States to upload and share photos.
After register you edit the profile with your first name that will appear in the title next to a profile picture and you can add an unlimited number of pictures by clicking the plus button and also edit the profile description by clicking the pencil button to tell more about yourself and edit the description if necessary at any time.
At the end of the site there is a copyright watermark.

**technologies and techniques**
For the profile info and cards section I use grid layout to adjust the sizes for each area and column. In the profile info i used "grid-template-areas" to specify every area in the grid and place it where it belongs.

In the cards grid layout I arranged all columns to be the same size no matter how many cards will be added in the future and added gaps so the cards will have have space between them.

I used responsive design to adjust the website for different screen sizes so for doing that i used media queries for three screen options

1. 920px- I added padding to the screen sides so the elements wont be adjacent to the sides with no space
2. 750px- I shrinked the add button so it wont touch the edit button
3. 650px- I decreased the size of title and description text and arranged the profile picture to be in the middle of the screen
   I also increased the add button to be 100% page width.

For every clickable button there is a hover state that's changing the opacity of the buttons.
